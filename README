1. Introduction

This version of Minesweeper was coded and compiled using Borland C++ compiler.

The compiler is obsolete, but it happened to be my first game. It does not
conform to any standard and puts all the bombs randomly in the board. This does
sometimes result in inconsistencies. Otherwise, the game is pretty straight-
forward and simple to play.

It features four difficulty levels, each with varying board size and number of
bombs. There is no high-score system yet, but may be added later.

The code is in no way clean or efficient, but then it was my first game, that
too with very basic knowledge.

I may also port it to C sometime later, conforming to latest C11 standard.

2. System Requirements

- OS: Microsoft Windows (any)
- Compiler: Borland C++ Compiler

3. How to play

The gameplay is pretty straight-forward, with well laid down menus.

- To select an option, enter the number which precedes it.
- For row and column, enter the corresponding row and column from the grid.

4. Understanding the code

The code, as I said, is not really clean, and can use a lot of improvement and
optimisation.

The difficulty boards for all grids are predefined double dimensional arrays.
At all stages where the program needs to differentiate as to which board it
needs to work upon, it simply checks the value of 'diff', which holds the value
for difficulty. Rest of the documentation will soon be done in the code by the
comments.
